// A demo application, showing how to create and run a RTSP client (that can potentially receive multiple streams concurrently).
//
// NOTE: This code - although it builds a running application - is intended only to illustrate how to develop your own RTSP
// client application.  For a full-featured RTSP client application - with much more functionality, and many options - see
// "openRTSP": http://www.live555.com/openRTSP/

#include "rtsp_decode_client.h"
#include <fstream>

// Forward function definitions:

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Begin by setting up our usage environment:

  // We need at least one "rtsp://" URL argument:
  if (argc < 2) {
    return 1;
  }

  /*
  // There are argc-1 URLs: argv[1] through argv[argc-1].  Open and start streaming each one:
  for (int i = 1; i <= argc-1; ++i) {
    openURL(*env, argv[0], argv[i]);
  }
  */

  
  RtspDecodeClient client;
  std::string progName(*argv[0]);
  std::string url(*argv[1]);
  client.OpenUrl(progName, url);
  // All subsequent activity takes place within the event loop:
    // This function call does not return, unless, at some point in time, "eventLoopWatchVariable" gets set to something non-zero.

  return 0;

  // If you choose to continue the application past this point (i.e., if you comment out the "return 0;" statement above),
  // and if you don't intend to do anything more with the "TaskScheduler" and "UsageEnvironment" objects,
  // then you can also reclaim the (small) memory used by these objects by uncommenting the following code:
  /*
    env->reclaim(); env = NULL;
    delete scheduler; scheduler = NULL;
  */
}

// Define a class to hold per-stream state that we maintain throughout each stream's lifetime:


// Define a data sink (a subclass of "MediaSink") to receive the data for each subsession (i.e., each audio or video 'substream').
// In practice, this might be a class (or a chain of classes) that decodes and then renders the incoming audio or video.
// Or it might be a "FileSink", for outputting the received data into a file (as is done by the "openRTSP" application).
// In this example code, however, we define a simple 'dummy' sink that receives incoming data, but does nothing with it.
